== Using the CDK Track ðŸ’›

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation. CDK allows you to use familiar programming languages to define your cloud resources.

It's *one of the two* infrastructure tracks we provide with the CloudWatch book.

If you're looking for Terraform, please refer to the link:terraform.adoc[ðŸ’œ Terraform Track].

=== Installing CDK

To get started with CDK, you need to install the AWS CDK Toolkit (cdk command-line tool) on your local machine.

==== macOS and Linux

With macOS and Linux, the installation process is quite straightforward:

* Install the AWS CDK Toolkit via npm:

[source,sh]
----
npm install -g aws-cdk
----

* Verify the installation:

[source,sh]
----
cdk --version
----

==== Windows

On Windows, you can follow the same instructions as on Linux. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed and you're using link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install[WSL] (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

=== Applying our Infrastructure

We've bundled everything into a single deploy script to make it easier for you to get started.

But let's have a look at the folder structure first:

[source,plaintext]
----
root/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lambda/
â”œâ”€â”€ infra/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cdk/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ build-deploy.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cdk
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deploy.sh
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ destroy.sh
----

What is what?

* `backend/lambda/` - contains our Lambda functions
* `infra/cdk/` - contains our CDK configuration
* `scripts/frontend/` - contains the script to build and deploy the frontend (exported as static HTML, so it's only uploaded to the S3 bucket)
* `scripts/cdk/deploy.sh` - the script to deploy the CDK stack
* `scripts/cdk/destroy.sh` - the script to destroy the CDK stack

So this means, to apply the infrastructure you only need to run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
./scripts/deploy-cdk.sh
----

On the first run, you'll be prompted if the AWS account you're currently logged into is correct.
If not, you can abort the process and switch to the correct account.

The script will create a `variables.env` file for you which will contain the AWS account ID.

Afterward, CDK will already be executed! ðŸŽ‰
