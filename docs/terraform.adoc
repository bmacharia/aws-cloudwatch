== Using the Terraform Track ðŸ’œ

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

It's one of two infrastructure tracks we provide with the CloudWatch book.

=== Installing Terraform

To get started with Terraform, you need to install the binary on your local machine. We recommend to use the `tfenv` tool to manage different versions of Terraform.

==== macOS

With macOS, the installation process is quite straightforward:

* Install link:https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tfenv[tfenv] via Homebrew:

[source,sh]
----
brew install tfenv
----

* If it wasn't done automatically, don't forget to extend your PATH variable to include the `tfenv` binary:

[source,sh]
----
# bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.tfenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
# zsh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.tfenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zprofile
----

That's already it.
As the `infra/terraform` folder contains a `.terraform_version` file, `tfenv` will take care of the correct version for you.

==== Linux

The process on Linux is quite similar to macOS.
Please use the instructions in the link:https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv[tfenv GitHub repository] to install the tool.

For example:

* via Arch User Repository

[source,sh]
----
yay --sync tfenv
----

* or via the GitHub repository

[source,sh]
----
git clone git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv.git ~/.tfenv
# please export the binary path to your PATH
# bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.tfenv/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
# zsh
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.tfenv/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
----

==== Windows

On Windows with WSL, you can follow the Linux instructions.
You only need another export command for your PATH:

[source,sh]
----
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.tfenv/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
----


=== Applying our Infrastructure

We've bundled everything into a single deploy script to make it easier for you to get started.

But let's have a look at the folder structure first:

[source,plaintext]
----
root/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lambda/
â”œâ”€â”€ infra/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ terraform/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ install.sh
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ transpile.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ build-deploy.sh
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apply-terraform.sh
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ destroy-terraform.sh
----

What is what?

* `backend/lambda/` - contains our Lambda functions
* `infra/terraform/` - contains our Terraform configuration
* `scripts/backend/` - contains the scripts to install and transpile the Lambda functions
* `scripts/frontend/` - contains the script to build and deploy the frontend (exported as static HTML, so it's only uploaded to the S3 bucket)
* `scripts/apply-terraform.sh` - the script to apply the Terraform configuration
* `scripts/destroy-terraform.sh` - the script to destroy the Terraform configuration

So this means, to apply the infrastructure you only need to run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
./scripts/apply-terraform.sh
----

On the first run, you'll be prompted if the AWS account you're currently logged into is correct.
If not, you can abort the process and switch to the correct account.

Let's have a look at the script's output on the first run:

[source,text]
----
$ ./scripts/apply-terraform.sh

No environment specified, defaulting to 'dev'.
Generated project suffix: 609ftfma
variables.tfvars file created with project suffix.
Use AWS account id 590183990318? (y/n): y
AWS account id added to variables.tfvars.
Enter Discord Webhook URL for alerting (leave empty to skip):
Discord Webhook URL skipped. Please remove the line from variables.tfvars if needed later
S3 bucket cw-ho-tf-state-609ftfma created successfully.
backend.tfvars file created with bucket name.
DynamoDB lock table already exists.
Enter email addresses for alerting (comma separated - leave empty to skip):
Email addresses for alerting not provided.
Installing dependencies and transpiling the backend...
Applying Terraform configuration for dev environment...
----

The script will create two files for you:

* `backend.tfvars` - contains the bucket name for the Terraform state, e.g. `bucket = "cw-ho-tf-state-609ftfma"`
* `variables.tfvars` - contains the project suffix and the AWS account ID, e.g. `project_suffix = "609ftfma"` and `aws_account_id = "590183990318"` and the discord webhook URL / alerting emails if provided

It will also create...

* the S3 bucket for the Terraform state
* the DynamoDB lock table for the Terraform state

Afterward, Terraform will already be executed! ðŸŽ‰
