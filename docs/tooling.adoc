== Installing the Necessary Tools

You need to have the following tools installed:

- link:https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[NVM]: Node Version Manager is used to easily install and manage multiple versions of Node.js and npm. Alternatively, you can directly install link:https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] and link:https://www.npmjs.com/[npm] if you prefer.
- link:https://pnpm.io/[pnpm]: A fast, disk space-efficient package manager. It is recommended to use pnpm instead of npm or yarn. This is not strictly necessary though.
- link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI]: The AWS Command Line Interface is used to interact with AWS services from the command line. It's also used by our deployment scripts.

Depending on the track(s) you want to follow, you also need to install the link:https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/[Cloud Development Kit] and/or link:https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform], but more on that in the dedicated chapters.

=== macOS

With macOS, the installation process is quite straightforward:

* Install link:https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] if you don't have it.

[source,sh]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----

* Install link:https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nvm[NVM] via homebrew.

[source,sh]
----
brew install nvm
----

Please make sure that the binary is exported in your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`). NVM will provide you with the necessary instructions after installation.

* Install Node.js and npm using NVM:

[source,sh]
----
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
# you can also install a specific version
----

* Install pnpm:

[source,sh]
----
npm install -g pnpm
----

* Install AWS CLI:

[source,sh]
----
brew install awscli
----

=== Linux

On Linux, the installation process is similar to macOS:

* Install NVM:

[source,sh]
----
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
----

As with macOS, please make sure that the binary is exported in your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`). NVM will provide you with the necessary instructions after installation.

* Install Node.js and npm using NVM:

[source,sh]
----
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
# you can also install a specific version
----

* Install pnpm:

[source,sh]
----
npm install -g pnpm
----

* Install AWS CLI:

[source,sh]
----
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
----


=== Windows

If you're working with Windows, you need to use link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install[WSL] (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

With this, you can run a Linux distribution on your Windows machine, which basically allow you to follow the Linux instructions.

After you've successfully installed WSL, you can enter the Linux shell by running `wsl` in your command prompt.

****
*Important*: You'll also need to transpile our bash scripts via `dos2unix` or a similar tool, as the line endings are different on Windows. You can install `dos2unix` via `sudo apt install dos2unix` on your WSL.
Afterwards, you should transpile all files inside the `scripts` directory by running `dos2unix scripts/*`.

=== Next Steps

Once you have all the tools installed, you can proceed to deploy the code from the repository. Follow the instructions either from the link:../docs/cdk.adoc[ðŸ’› CDK track] or the link:../docs/terraform.adoc[ðŸ’œ Terraform track].
